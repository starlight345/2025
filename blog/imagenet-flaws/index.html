It was to become the first large-scale labeled image dataset, marking a transformative moment in computer vision. In its construction, the authors followed the structure of WordNet<d-cite key="3"></d-cite> — a lexical database that organizes words into a semantic hierarchy. With over 3 million labeled images from more than 5,000 categories in 2009, it far surpassed previous commonly used datasets, which contained only tens of thousands of images (e.g., LabelMe with 37,000 images, PASCAL VOC with 30,000 images, CalTech101 with 9,000 images). This unprecedented scale allowed ImageNet to capture a diverse range of real-world objects and scenes. As of November 2024, the ImageNet<d-cite key="2"></d-cite> paper has since been cited over 76,000 times according to Google Scholar, and more than 34,000 times in IEEE Xplore, underscoring its profound impact on computer vision. Its influence is so significant that even in other fields of machine learning, the expression “ImageNet moment” is used to describe groundbreaking developments.</p> <p>Introduced in 2012, <strong>ImageNet-1k</strong><d-cite key="1"></d-cite> was created specifically for the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC). It contains 1,000 diverse classes of animals, plants, foods, tools, and environments (e.g., lakesides, valleys). It includes a training set of over 1 million images from the original ImageNet, along with validation and test sets of 50,000 and 100,000 images, respectively. The evaluation subsets were formed by a process following the original dataset creation. It is important to note that, since the test set labels are not publicly available, the validation set is typically used for model evaluation.</p> <h4 id="problems">Problems</h4> <p>We were aware that ImageNet-1k had issues, which is common in real-world datasets. However, while analyzing model errors for another project, we were surprised by the size of the effects of the problems related to the ground truth. We decided to investigate them in greater detail. The initial goal looked simple: correct the labels to reduce noise — a task we assumed would be straightforward. However, upon further examination, we discovered that the issues were complex and far more deeply rooted.</p> <p>The easy-to-solve issues, such as incorrect image labels, redundant classes, and duplicate images, can be addressed by relabeling, merging classes, and cleaning up duplicates. However, there are other issues, such as a distribution shift between the training and evaluation subsets, where we see no fully backward-compatible solution. The domain shift could even be seen as a feature rather than a bug since in real deployment, test and training data are never i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed). The inclusion of images depicting objects from multiple ImageNet classes, called multilabel images, poses another problem with no straightforward solution. Their removal is a possibility when ImageNet-1k is used for training. However, their prevalence, which we estimate to be in the 15 to 21% range in the validation set, probably rules out adopting this solution. Other modifications of the evaluation protocol might be preferable, e.g. considering any predicted label from the multilabel ground-truth set as correct. Referred to as ReaL accuracy <d-cite key="5"></d-cite>, it has already been reported alongside the standard accuracy.</p> <h2 id="known-imagenet-1k-issues">Known ImageNet-1k Issues</h2> <p>Prior studies identified and analyzed many ImageNet issues, but they each deal only with a specific concern and usually focus on the validation set. The topic that received the most attention is annotation errors, which distort the evaluation of model accuracy <d-cite key="4,6,5,7,9"></d-cite>. Overlapping class definitions were reported in Vasudevan et al.<d-cite key="8"></d-cite>. Duplicate images were mentioned in several papers <d-cite key="8, 11, 16"></d-cite>.</p> <details> <summary style="font-weight:800">Prior Work in Detail</summary> <div style="margin:15px 0px 15px 0;"> <span style="font-weight:800">Imagenet Multilabel<d-cite key="4"></d-cite>:</span> the authors reannotated a class-balanced subset of images, covering 40% of the validation set. The main focus was on assigning multiple labels to capture the presence of several objects from different ImageNet classes.

For the remaining images, labels were manually reviewed by five human annotators.

The discrepancies between the studies arise from each following its own methodology, leading to varying interpretations of the class definitions and different approaches to resolving issues encountered during annotation.</p> <h2 id="dataset-construction-issues">Dataset Construction Issues</h2> <p>Let us first examine the two-step process used to construct ImageNet:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>Image collection.</strong> Images were scraped from the web and organized according to the WordNet hierarchy, which will be revisited later. Both automated and manual methods were involved: automated tools initially assigned labels based on metadata available (textual description, category) at the image source, often <a href="https://flickr.com" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">flickr</a>.</li> <li> <strong>Annotation process</strong>. The preliminary labels were then reviewed by MTurk workers, who were only asked to confirm whether the object with the given label was present in the image. Notably, no alternative labels were suggested, such as other similar classes. The MTurkers were shown the target synset definition and a link to Wikipedia.</li> </ol> <p><strong>ImageNet-1k</strong> consists of three sets: a <em>training set</em> with over 1 million images, a <em>validation set</em> with 50,000 images, and a <em>test set</em> with 100,000 images. The training set is drawn from ImageNet. Images for the evaluation subsets were obtained through a process that tried to replicate the one used for the ImageNet. The new data were collected up to three years later than training data and then they were randomly split between the validation and test sets.</p> <p>ImageNet links each image category to a <strong>WordNet</strong> noun synset. WordNet is a comprehensive lexical database of English. It organizes nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs into synonym sets, or synsets, each representing a unique concept (see the official <a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>).</p> <p>Each <strong>synset</strong> should consist of one or more terms referred to as “synonyms”, for example, <em>“church, church building”</em>. However, they are not synonyms in all cases. For example, consider the synset <em>“diaper, nappy, napkin”</em>. The first two terms are synonyms, the third one is not. Moreover, there are cases where the same term is in more than one synset, e.g. there are two synsets named <em>“crane”</em> — one defining a bird and the second a machine. In ImageNet-1k, they are separate classes. Think about the consequences for zero-shot classification with vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP<d-cite key="15"></d-cite>.</p> <p>We will demonstrate some issues related to dataset construction with a few examples.</p> <h3 id="the-cat-problem">The Cat Problem</h3> <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; row-gap: 15px; column-gap: 15px; justify-items: center;"> <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-imagenet-flaws/tiger_cat_1.png" style="height: 140px;"> <p>(a)</p> </div> <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-imagenet-flaws/tiger_cat_2.png" style="height: 140px; "> <p>(b)</p> </div> <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-imagenet-flaws/tiger_cat_3.png" style="height: 140px;"> <p>(c)</p> </div> <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-imagenet-flaws/tiger_cat_4.png" style="height: 140px;"> <p>(d)</p> </div> </div> <div style="margin: 15px 0px 25px 0px; color:grey; font-size:14px; font-weight:600; line-height: 1.3;"> Figure 4. Images from the <em style="color:grey;">"tiger cat"</em> class. (a) is a tiger cat. (b) is a cat, but the coat pattern is not clearly visible, it might be a <em style="color:grey;">"tabby, tabby cat"</em>, another ImageNet-1k class. (c) is a wild cat from the <em style="color:grey;">Leopardus</em> genus, not a domestic cat. (d) is a tiger. </div> <p>Looking at the <strong><em>“tiger cat”</em></strong> images above, you might think “This seems to be a really diverse dataset…”. Let us have a closer look. The <em>“tiger cat”</em> class is defined in WordNet as <strong>“a cat having a striped coat”</strong>, which aligns precisely with (a).</p> <p>To understand the issue with (b), we must know that ImageNet-1k also includes a <strong><em>“tabby, tabby cat”</em></strong> class, defined as <strong>“a cat with a grey or tawny coat mottled with black”</strong>. In common usage, tabby cat refers broadly to any domestic cat with a striped, spotted, or swirled coat pattern, all of which must include an “M” marking on their forehead (which can be seen in this image). Most dictionaries agree that all tiger cats are tabbies, but not all tabby cats have the tiger pattern. However, even if we look at image (b) through the lens of WordNet definitions, it shows a grey cat, but its coat is not clearly visible. Moreover, the term “mottled coat” in the tabby cat definition can be somewhat confusing, as some dictionaries consider stripes to be a type of mottling. So, how do we determine which type of cat this is?</p> <p>We find modern large language models (LLMs) to be more accurate when handling such questions, so we asked them whether these two definitions overlap:</p> <div class="llm-cite"> Yes, the "tabby, tabby cat" definition and the "tiger cat" definition overlap. While the first definition is broader in its description of coloration and pattern, the second one specifies the striped aspect, which is a common characteristic of the broader "mottled" description in the first. </div> <p>– <em>ChatGPT-4o</em></p> <div class="llm-cite">Yes - a tabby cat definition ("a cat with a grey or tawny coat mottled with black") overlaps with the tiger cat definition ("a cat having a striped coat") since "mottled with black" typically manifests as stripes in domestic cats.</div> <p>– <em>Claude 3.5 Sonnet</em></p> <div class="llm-cite">Yes, mottled patterns can sometimes include stripes, so the "tabby, tabby cat" definition can occasionally overlap with the "tiger cat" definition.</div> <p>– <em>Microsoft Copilot</em></p> <p>This raises the question: <em>If WordNet definitions are not precise enough, what is the ultimate source for correct image labels? ChatGPT, Wikipedia, GBIF?</em></p> <p>We are not wildlife experts, but we may say that either an oncilla, ocelot, or margay is in (c). While this might seem like harmless noise, common in such large datasets, these animals do appear more than once in the training set. In everyday language, <em>“tiger cat”</em> is more commonly used to refer to these wild cats than to striped domestic ones; however, these usages coexist simultaneously.</p> <p>We have already mentioned the WordNet definition of the <em>“tiger cat”</em> synset; WordNet also contains a <strong><em>“tiger cat, Felis tigrina”</em></strong> synset, defined as <strong>“a medium-sized wildcat of Central America and South America having a dark-striped coat”</strong>. All three cat species we have mentioned as possible labels for (c) fit the definition. Consistently annotating <em>“tiger cat”</em> images given such confusing background information is difficult for experts, and probably impossible for MTurkers.</p> <p>Obviously, (d) is a tiger, which has a class, <strong><em>“tiger, Panthera tigris”</em></strong>. Tigers make up a significant portion of the “tiger cat” class in both the training and validation sets. Distinguishing between a tabby and a tiger is not a challenging recognition task and yet the non-expert annotators made many mistakes. This highlights the need to think carefully about the expertise of and guidelines for the annotators.</p> <h3 id="the-laptop-problem">The Laptop Problem</h3> <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); row-gap: 15px; column-gap: 35px; justify-items: center;"> <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-imagenet-flaws/laptop.png" style="height: 190px; margin-top: 30px;"> <p><em>"laptop, laptop computer"</em></p> </div> <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-imagenet-flaws/notebook.png" style="height: 190px; margin-top: 30px;"> <p><em>"notebook, notebook computer"</em></p> </div> </div> <div style="margin: 15px 0px 25px 0px; color:grey; font-size:14px; font-weight:600; line-height: 1.3;">Figure 5.

Their respective WordNet definitions are “a portable computer small enough to use in your lap” and “a small compact portable computer”.

We again asked modern LLMs about the difference between laptop and notebook:</p> <div class="llm-cite">Previously, "laptops" referred to portable computers with larger screens and more powerful hardware, while "notebooks" were slimmer, lighter, and less powerful.

WordNet is not error-free and fully consistent; the issues propagate to ImageNet. Also, some meanings shift over time, which is a problem in the era of VLMs. Perhaps WordNet and ImageNet should co-evolve.</p> <p>Relying solely on MTurkers and using Wikipedia (a source that may be continuously edited by non-experts and may lack precise definitions) not only led to the inclusion of noisy labels but also sometimes distorted the very concepts that the classes were intended to represent. For example, the <em>“sunglasses, dark glasses, shades”</em> and <em>“sunglass”</em> classes represent the same object — sunglasses. While this is accurate for the “sunglasses”, the “sunglass” class is defined in WordNet as “a convex lens that focuses the rays of the sun; used to start a fire”. This definition was lost during the dataset construction process, resulting in two classes representing the same concept.</p> <h2 id="distribution-shift-between-training-and-validation-sets">Distribution Shift Between Training and Validation Sets</h2> <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; row-gap: 15px; column-gap: 15px; justify-items: center;"> <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-imagenet-flaws/canoe.png" style="height: 130px;"> <p>(a)</p> </div> <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-imagenet-flaws/kayak.png" style="height: 130px; "> <p>(b)</p> </div> <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-imagenet-flaws/canoe_paddle.png" style="height: 130px;"> <p>(c)</p> </div> <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-imagenet-flaws/kayak_paddle.png" style="height: 130px;"> <p>(d)</p> </div> </div> <div style="margin: 15px 0px 25px 0px; color:grey; font-size:14px; font-weight:600; line-height: 1.3;"> Figure 6.

Additionally, desktop computers are generally placed on desks (also a class), so these two objects often appear together in images. Many cases of multilabel image issues stemming from frequently co-occurring classes exist.</p> <p>The issue runs deeper, and the authors’ claim that there is no overlap and no parent-child relationship between classes appears to be incorrect. Consider the example of a “spacebar” and a “computer keyboard”. The “space bar” may not always be part of a “computer keyboard”, but most “keyboards” do have a “space bar”.</p> <p>Let us look at another example.</p> <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); row-gap: 15px; column-gap: 35px; justify-items: center;"> <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-imagenet-flaws/car_wheel.png" style="height: 190px; margin-top: 30px;"> <p><em>"car wheel"</em></p> </div> <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-imagenet-flaws/sports_car.png" style="height: 190px; margin-top: 30px;"> <p><em>"sports car, sport car"</em></p> </div> </div> <div style="margin: 15px 0px 25px 0px; color:grey; font-size:14px; font-weight:600; line-height: 1.3;"> Figure 9.

When an image contains both, and many do, it is unclear which label should take priority.

One reason the dataset is so widely used is that it is perceived to reflect the diversity of the real world. Yet, the class distribution is skewed. Does having more than 10% of the dataset represent dog breeds truly capture the human experience as a whole, or is it more reflective of dog owners’ perspective?

However, given that the test and validation sets were created simultaneously by splitting the collected evaluation data, we can infer that the situation is likely similar to the validation set. This suggests that each image in a pair belongs to a different class, which sets a lower bound on accuracy on the test set.</p> </li> </ul> <p>After finding exact duplicates, we removed them and recalculated the accuracies of two models: OpenCLIP and an ImageNet-pretrained CNN EfficientNetV2.

Next, we removed all duplicate images in the validation set that were also present in the training set (Table 4, x Cross). Finally, we combined these two methods to remove all exact duplicates (Table 4, x Val+Cross). In summary, our approach led to a 0.7% accuracy increase for the zero-shot model and a 1% accuracy increase for the pretrained CNN.

Correctly labeled ImageNet-1k images from the <em>"weasel"</em>, <em>"mink"</em>, <em>"polecat"</em>, and <em>"black-footed ferret"</em> classes. The ground truth labels for these categories are often wrong, mainly confusing these species. </div> <p>These classes have a high percentage of incorrect ground truth labels, both in the training and validation sets. Most of the errors are caused by confusion between the four classes but the sets also contain images depicting animals from other ImageNet-1k classes, such as otter or badger, as well as images from classes not in ImageNet-1k, e.g. vole or tayra. But that is not the sole issue.</p> <h3 id="the-weasel-problem">The Weasel Problem</h3> <p>Let us look at the <em>“weasel”</em> class definitions:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>WordNet</strong>: small carnivorous mammal with short legs and elongated body and neck.</li> <li> <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></strong>: the English word weasel was originally applied to one species of the genus, the European form of the least weasel (<em>Mustela nivalis</em>). This usage is retained in British English, where the name is also extended to cover several other small species of the genus. However, in technical discourse and in American usage, the term weasel can refer to any member of the genus, the genus as a whole, and even to members of the related genus <em>Neogale</em>.</li> <li> <strong><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/weasel" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Webster</a></strong>: any of various small slender active carnivorous mammals (genus <em>Mustela</em> of the family <em>Mustelidae</em>, the weasel family) that can prey on animals (such as rabbits) larger than themselves, are mostly brown with white or yellowish underparts, and in northern forms turn white in winter.</li> </ul> <p>The definition of the <em>“weasel”</em> synset in WordNet is broad - it potentially encompasses all the other mentioned classes. Moreover, the interpretation of the term weasel varies, between UK and US English, further complicating its consistent application. In US English, the term weasel often refers to the whole <em>Mustelidae</em>, also called ‘the weasel family’. All of the following - weasel, mink, European polecat, and black-footed ferret - belong to the weasel family, as understood by US English. One possible solution is to define the <em>“weasel”</em> class more precisely as the subgenus <em>Mustela</em>, which contains the ‘least weasel’ and other very similar species, which would lead only to the removal of a few images.</p> <div class="theme-image"></div> <div style="margin: 15px 0px 25px 0px; color:grey; font-size:14px; font-weight:600; line-height: 1.3;"> Figure 19. A simplified branching diagram showing the <em style="color:grey;">Mustelidae</em> family, also referred to as 'the weasel family', or simply 'weasels' in US English. Some of ImageNet classes are: <em style="color:grey;">"weasel"</em>, <em style="color:grey;">"polecat"</em>, <em style="color:grey;">"black-footed ferret"</em> and <em style="color:grey;">"mink"</em>. All of these belong to the weasel family, pointing at yet another issue with class names. Images of these classes also depict species outside of ImageNet, such as tayras or voles, or even different ImageNet classes, such as otter or badger. The diagram shows evolutionary relationships between selected species from the ImageNet dataset; the circles mark higher taxonomic units. </div> <h3 id="the-ferret-problem">The Ferret Problem</h3> <p>Another complication arises with the <em>“black-footed ferret”</em> and <em>“polecat”</em> classes:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>WordNet synset name:</strong> <em>“black-footed ferret, ferret, Mustela nigripes”</em> </li> <li> <strong>ferret, <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ferret" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Webster</a>:</strong> ‘a domesticated usually albino, brownish, or silver-gray animal (<em>Mustela furo</em> synonym <em>Mustela putorius furo</em>) that is descended from the European polecat’.</li> <li> <strong>black-footed ferret, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-footed_ferret" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:</strong> ‘the black-footed ferret is roughly the size of a mink and is similar in appearance to the European polecat and the Asian steppe polecat’.</li> </ul> <p>The synset <em>“black-footed ferret, ferret, Mustela nigripes”</em> includes both the term ‘black-footed ferret’ and ‘ferret’. The latter refers to a domesticated variety of the European polecat. Consequently, the term ‘ferret’ is ambiguous; it may be understood both as a synonym for the black-footed ferret or as the domesticated polecat. Additionally, the domestic ferret and European polecat are nearly indistinguishable to non-specialists; even experts may face difficulties because these species can interbreed. There is also a potential for contextual bias in labeling, as ferrets are commonly found in domestic environments or in the presence of humans.</p> <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); row-gap: 15px; column-gap: 35px; justify-items: center;"> <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-imagenet-flaws/eu_polecat.png" style="height: 190px; width: 300px; margin-top: 30px;"> <p>European polecat</p> </div> <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-imagenet-flaws/dom_polecat.png" style="height: 190px; width: 300px; margin-top: 30px;"> <p>domestic ferret</p> </div> </div> <div style="margin: 15px 0px 25px 0px; color:grey; font-size:14px; font-weight:600; line-height: 1.3;"> Figure 20.

These species share the term 'polecat' in their synsets but belong to different families (see Figure 19). </div> <p>To solve the ‘ferret’ issues, redefinition of classes might be needed, e.g.:</p> <ol> <li>Introduction of a distinct class for ferret, specifically denoting the domesticated form of the European polecat.</li> <li>Reclassification of the term polecat so that it no longer appears in the synset for skunk; instead, this term should be used to represent a broader category encompassing both the European polecat and American polecat (also referred to as the black-footed ferret), as well as other species, such as the marbled, steppe, and striped polecats.</li> <li>Create a class that encompasses both polecats and ferrets.</li> </ol> <h3 id="results-of-relabeling">Results of Relabeling</h3> <p>After relabeling the weasel family classes, we found that only the <em>“mink”</em> class had more than 50% of the original labels correct.

Most of the issues have been known to exist, like the presence of: incorrectly labeled images, multilabel images with no obvious correct label, overlapping class definitions, and the presence of intra-set duplicates and near-duplicate instances.</p> <p>The analysis here is more in-depth provides new quantitative information about the phenomena and presents new findings, e.g. about the distribution shift between the training and validation sets, intra-set duplicates, and near-duplicate instances within both training and validation sets. We also introduce new, improved class names for zero-shot recognition with VLMs, as well as a refined taxonomy of problematic classes—such as hierarchical and duplicate classes—while introducing new ones, e.g. “part-of” and co-occurrence relationships.</p> <p>For many problems, we provide exemplars, such as the expert-led case study of closely related <em>weasel family</em> species, which highlights the complexity of fine-grained classification. The training-validation domain shift is demonstrated on the <em>canoe &amp; kayak</em> and <em>planetaria</em> classes. We discuss the causes of the problems, some rooted in ImageNet’s dataset collection process, particularly the reliance on untrained Mechanical Turk workers, and some originating from ambiguous WordNet definitions, exemplified by the <em>tiger cat</em> class.</p> <p>At a technical level, we consolidate and publish prior ImageNet-1k label error corrections, resulting in the <a href="https://github.com/klarajanouskova/ImageNet/blob/main/eval_corrections/verify_images/results/clean_validation.csv" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“clean validation set”</a> with consistent image labels from previous studies, and provide the improved VLM zero-shot prompts for all ImageNet classes.</p> <h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2> <p>The blog mainly focuses on a precise description of the issues and their scale, i.e., what fraction of the image-label pairs it affects. We hope that one of the outcomes of publishing this analysis will be a broader exchange of ideas on what is and what is not worth fixing. Every solution will involve trade-offs, at least between correctness and backward compatibility. The wide use of ImageNet-1k makes it difficult to assess the full impact of any change; possibly we are heading towards multiple evaluation protocols and ground-truth versions.</p> <p>The activity opened many questions. First and foremost: “Is this worth it?” and “Will the community benefit from (much) more accurate ImageNet-1k re-labeling and class definitions?”. For the validation set, which is used for performance evaluation of a wide range of models, the answer seems a clear “yes”. For the training set, we see benefits too. For instance, it seems that learning a fine-grained model from very noisy data is very challenging. The answers to the questions above depend on the effort needed to re-label the images and to clean the class definitions. Our experience is that current tools, both state-of-the-art classifiers and zero-shot VLM models, reduce the need for manual effort significantly.</p> <p>The effort to find precise, unambiguous definitions of the ImageNet-1k classes lead us to the use of VLMs and LLMs. The LLM responses were accurate and informative if prompted properly, even warning about common causes of confusion. Our experience suggests that LLMs are very suitable for both annotator training and decision support.</p> <p>We hired an expert annotator in order to obtain precise annotation of the weasel-like animal classes analyzed in the case study. Expert annotators help identify subtle nuances and complexities within the dataset that might be easily overlooked by non-specialists. On the other hand, their understanding of certain terms might not coincide with common usage. We might need parameterizable VLM models, e.g., for professional and technical use as well as for the vernacular. Prior work<d-cite key="7"></d-cite> used MTurkers to find incorrect labels. However, we found that they missed many problems. Their errors are not independent, and attempts to remove them by e.g. majority voting or consensus, failed to detect them. When it comes to highly accurate labels, an expert is worth not a thousand, but any number of MTurkers.</p> <p>In many areas of computer vision, models reached accuracy comparable to the so-called ground truth, losing the compass pointing to better performance. As we have seen, improving ground truth quality is not a simple task of checking and re-checking, but touches on some core issues of both vision and language modeling. This blog is a small step towards resetting the compass for ImageNet-1k.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> </div> <d-bibliography src="/2025/assets/bibliography/2025-04-28-imagenet-flaws.bib"></d-bibliography> <d-article id="bibtex-container" class="related highlight"> For attribution in academic contexts, please cite this work as <pre id="bibtex-academic-attribution">
