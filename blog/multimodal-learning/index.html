We use <strong>vision</strong> to see, <strong>olfaction</strong> to smell, <strong>audition</strong> to hear, and we communicate through <strong>speech</strong>. Similarly, with recent multi-modal artificial intelligence (AI) advancements, we now see <a href="https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-can-now-see-hear-and-speak/" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">articles</a> announcing “ChatGPT can <strong>see, hear and speak”</strong>. But there’s a fundamental question underlying this progress:</p> <aside class="box-note l-body"> <p>Does the definition of a “modality” align between humans and AI?</p> </aside> <p>To unpack this question, we show examples that illustrate the basic ambiguity of defining modalities for machine learning.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <div style="background-color: white; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-multimodal-learning/modality_types-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-multimodal-learning/modality_types-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-multimodal-learning/modality_types-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-multimodal-learning/modality_types.png" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> A dog image with caption represented with RGB channels and texture as four image modalities, alongside tokenization strategies as modalities for text. </div> </div> </div> <p><strong>Example 1: Images</strong></p> <p>Images are commonly considered as a single modality for both humans and AI. For humans, an image is a unified representation of visual information. However, machine learning models can perceive images in various ways :</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Color channels:</strong> RGB images comprise of Red, Green, and Blue (R, G, B) channels, each of which could be viewed as a separate component or modality.</li> <li> <strong>Derived Representations</strong>: We can generate secondary images highlighting specific features<d-cite key="zeng2024rgb"></d-cite>, such as material properties like shininess or texture.</li> <li> <strong>Image Patches:</strong> The image can be divided into smaller sections or patches of different sizes<d-cite key="dosovitskiy2021an"></d-cite>, capturing different parts of the image.</li> </ul> <p>These decompositions raise an important question:</p> <aside class="box-note l-body"> <p>Should each decomposition be considered as a modality, or are they simply variations of the image modality?</p> </aside> <p><strong>Example 2: Text</strong></p> <p>Text is commonly treated as a single modality in language models, however, the method of tokenization—how text is broken into atomic units—can vary widely:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Word-Level Tokenization:</strong> Sentences are split into individual words. For example, the sentence “The dog is on the grass” would be tokenized as (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dog</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">is</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">on</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grass</code>)</li> <li> <strong>Character-Level Tokenization:</strong> Each individual character is treated as a token, turning the same sentence into (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">h</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">e</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">o</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">g</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">o</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">h</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">e</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">g</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">r</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s</code>)</li> </ul> <p>This leads us to ask:</p> <aside class="box-note l-body"> <p>Should each tokenization be considered as a different modality or a different view of the text modality?</p> </aside> <p>Although the term “multi-view” is sometimes used to describe these variations, the line between “multi-view” and “multi-modal” is often blurred, adding to the confusion. This is an important question because often different tokenization strategies perform differently on different tasks<d-cite key="dang2024tokenization"></d-cite>. While BPE and UnigramLM i.e. world-level embeddings are commonly used for LLMs, character level encoding works better than world-level tokenization for multilingual translation<d-cite key="lee2017fully"></d-cite>.</p> <p><strong>Example 3: Medical data</strong></p> <p>Consider diagnosing skin lesion using both image data and tabular features, such as patient’s age, demographic information and characteristics of the lesion along with the anatomical region. Each modality independently and jointly contributes to detecting lesion<d-cite key="imrie2024automated"></d-cite>. This prompts the question,</p> <aside class="box-note l-body"> <p>Are images and tabular data separate modalities, or can they be unified under “patient” modality?</p> </aside> <h3 id="why-is-modality-grouping-information-important">Why is modality grouping information important?</h3> <p>The definition and grouping of modalities is important because it affects how we design models to process and integrate different types of data. Often the objective of prior studies is to ensure that models capture interactions between all mdoalities for the downstream task. This goal has led to two parallel lines of work. One approach focuses on developing new benchmarks to capture this interaction. These benchmarks often exhibit uni-modal biases, leading to subsequent iterations or new benchmarks intended to better evaluate multi-modal capabilities. The other approach emphasizes building complex architectures designed to learn interactions between modalities more effectively.</p> <p>In this blog post, we examine the community’s progress in both of these directions and why they have fallen short of meaningful impact. We then propose ways to analyze and capture the relative importance of individual modalities and their interaction for the downstream task.</p> <h2 id="reflection-on-the-progress-so-far">Reflection on the Progress so Far</h2> <p>Over the past decade, numerous multi-modal benchmarks and model architectures have been proposed to evaluate and enhance the multi-modal learning capabilities of AI models. Yet, we continue to struggle with making meaningful progress due to benchmarks not accurately representing real-world scenarios and models failing to capture the essential multi-modal dependencies effectively. We reflect on the progress made in these two areas and discuss why these approaches have not been sufficient in obtaining the desired results.</p> <h3 id="are-benchmarks-enough">Are benchmarks enough?</h3> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <div style="background-color: white; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-multimodal-learning/benchmarks-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-multimodal-learning/benchmarks-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-multimodal-learning/benchmarks-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-multimodal-learning/benchmarks.png" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> List of benchmarks for multi-modal learning from a recent work<d-cite key="tong2024cambrian"></d-cite>. </div> </div> </div> <p>Numerous benchmarks have been developed for multi-modal learning (see Figure above). Many were initially designed to evaluate whether models could effectively capture interactions between modalities for downstream tasks. The early benchmarks often exhibited a reliance on uni-modal biases, allowing models to perform well even when ignoring certain modalities<d-cite key="wang2020makes, tong2024cambrian"></d-cite>. Although subsequent iterations of these benchmarks made an attempt to address these issues, these updates often fail to fully resolve the underlying problems. Instead, they highlight persistent challenges that reflect the complexity of real-world scenarios where multi-modal models continue to struggle.</p> <p>For instance, consider visual question answering (VQA)<d-cite key="antol2015vqa"></d-cite>, which has undergone multiple updates since its inital release in 2015:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>VQAv2 (2016)</strong><d-cite key="goyal2017making"></d-cite>: Attempted to mitigate language bias by providing distinct answers for two different image-question pairs.

This definition should not be limited to human-perceived notions of modality but should critically evaluate and challenge these assumptions. The goal however is not merely to label an input as multi-modal; rather, it is to assess whether such labeling provides meaningful advantages for model performance or understanding.</p> <p>To answer that question, we recommend a thorough examination of the dependencies for each defined modality, both individually and jointly with other modalities for the target task. These dependencies are categorized as <strong><em>intra-modality dependencies</em></strong>, which represent interactions between individual modalities and the target label and <strong><em>inter-modality dependencies</em></strong>, which captures interaction between modalities and label.</p> <p>Several studies have evaluated benchmarks involving images and text as two modalities, and we illustrate how these dependencies differed across benchmarks based on prior studies<d-cite key="wang2020makes, du2023uni, tong2024cambrian, madaan2024jointly"></d-cite> in the Figure above. For datasets such as <strong><em>SQA-I, MMMU, fastMRI, MathVista, UCF101, intra-modality dependencies are more important</em></strong>, as removing one modality all together does not affect model performance. Conversely, for datasets like <strong><em>MMB, SEED-I, GQA, ChartQA and so on, both inter- and intra-modality dependencies are important</em></strong>, as both uni-modal and inter-modality models obtain more than random performance. For benchmarks such as <strong>MME, OCRBench, NLVR2 and others, inter-dependencies are more important</strong><em>;</em> removing one modality results in random performance; underscoring the importance of modality interactions.</p> <p>For all these benchmarks, specific architectural choices—such as the type of fusion method or the backbone architecture for vision and language models—exhibit minimal impact on performance, as noted in prior studies<d-cite key="wang2020makes, du2023uni, tong2024cambrian, madaan2024jointly"></d-cite>. Thus</p> <aside class="box-important l-body"> <p>The emphasis should be on analyzing how each modality contributes to task performance, both independently and jointly with other modalities.</p> </aside> <p>This analysis provides a better understanding of the importance of each modality and their interaction in the corresponding dataset.

Such an approach does not fundamentally alter the multi-modal learning problem; instead, it offers a structured way to balance individual and joint modality contributions. By explicitly modeling the importance of individual modalities, this approach mitigates uni-modal biases.</p> <aside class="box-important l-body"> <p>For multi-modal learning, we must model and combine both inter- and intra-modality dependencies.</p> </aside> <p>This comes with the trade-off of increased parameter requirements, which could impact efficiency. We believe future research should focus on optimizing this framework to reduce its computational cost. Progress in this direction is important, as current trends often attempt to address these challenges by either expanding datasets or increasing architectural complexity as highlighted above—approaches that have not led us to efficient or scalable solutions.</p> <h2 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h2> <p>Current approaches to multimodal learning tend to overemphasize the interaction between modalities for downstream tasks, resulting in benchmarks and architectures narrowly focused on modeling these interactions. In real-world scenarios, however, the strength of these interactions are often unkown. To build more effective multimodal models, we need to shift our focus toward holistically understandinging the independent contributions of each modality as well as their joint impact on the target task.</p> <h2 id="acknowledgement">Acknowledgement</h2> <p>This work was supported by the Institute of Information &amp; Communications Technology Planning &amp; Evaluation (IITP) with a grant funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) of the Republic of Korea in connection with the Global AI Frontier Lab International Collaborative Research, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (under the project Next Generation Deep Learning: From Pattern Recognition to AI), National Science Foundation (NSF) award No. 1922658, Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R), National Center for Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering operated by NYU Langone Health, and National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering through award number P41EB017183.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> </div> <d-bibliography src="/2025/assets/bibliography/2025-04-28-multimodal-learning.bib"></d-bibliography> <d-article id="bibtex-container" class="related highlight"> For attribution in academic contexts, please cite this work as <pre id="bibtex-academic-attribution">
