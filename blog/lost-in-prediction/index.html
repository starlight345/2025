In this context, a “narrative” is a belief about the state of the world that is shared by the population, regardless of the actual state of the economy. For example, a narrative might be the belief that housing prices are increasing, whereas in reality (according to economic indicators) they are stagnating.</p> <p>The central idea is that the spread of viral narratives can influence individual and collective economic behavior, leading to fluctuations in markets, changes in investment patterns, and even broader economic shifts.</p> <div style="width: 70%; margin: 0 auto;"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-lost-in-prediction/narrative_economics-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-lost-in-prediction/narrative_economics-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-lost-in-prediction/narrative_economics-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-lost-in-prediction/narrative_economics.png" class="img-fluid z-depth-2" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p><br> The term “Narrative Economics” is heavily attributed to Robert J. Shiller, a Nobel laureate economist and the founder of the field, who defined it as:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“Spread through the public in the form of popular stories, <strong>ideas can go viral and move markets</strong> —whether it’s the belief that tech stocks can only go up, that housing prices never fall, or that some firms are too big to fail. Whether true or false, stories like these—transmitted by word of mouth, by the news media, and increasingly by social media—<strong>drive the economy by driving our decisions about how and where to invest, how much to spend and save, and more.”</strong></em><br> <em>- Robert J. Shiller</em> <d-cite key="shiller2017narrative"></d-cite></p> </blockquote> <h2 id="the-ambiguity-of-the-term-narrative">The Ambiguity of the Term “Narrative”</h2> <p>The term “narrative” itself has different connotations in NLP compared to economics, which might lead to some confusion. 😵‍💫</p> <p><strong>In NLP</strong>, narrative commonly refers to the structure and elements of stories, encompassing aspects like plot, characters, setting, and theme. It involves understanding how these elements interrelate and contribute to the overall meaning and coherence of a narrative.</p> <p><strong>In Narrative Economics</strong>, as stated in the above section, narrative is a shared belief or idea that spreads through the population and potentially influences economic behavior.</p> <p><strong>Our research uses the term “narrative” in the economic sense.</strong> We’re interested in how shared beliefs about the economy can be used to predict market trends.</p> <h3 id="but-how-can-we-capture-such-narratives">But, how can we capture such narratives?</h3> <p>The economic term is wide and it is undefined what requirements a story or idea must have in order to be considered as “narrative”. Yet, we can look at some characteristics Shiller mentions <d-cite key="coursera_narratives"></d-cite> about narratives to have a better understanding:</p> <ul> <li>First, the story should be viral, publicly believed, in order to change a large enough audience to move the market.</li> <li>Second, Shiller uses some propositions while explaining the term. He states that “the economic impact of narratives may change through time” and “narrative constellations have more impact than any one narrative”.</li> <li>Last, Shiller mentions social media as a source of narratives and Google Ngram as a tool for tracking them.</li> </ul> <p>Combined together, to capture a narrative, one would need a good measure of what many people are discussing, over time. Twitter (X), in this case, is an almost ideal source of information for capturing this distribution of opinions.</p> <h3 id="and-how-to-extract-the-narrative-aspect-from-tweets">And how to extract the “narrative” aspect from tweets?</h3> <p>Aligning with Shiller’s arguments and with existing literature, the extraction might be (for example) a sentiment <d-cite key="macaulay2023narrative, yang2023multi, adams2023more, kim2023forecasting, gurgul2023forecasting, wang2023deepemotionnet"></d-cite>, a topic <d-cite key="ash2021relatio"></d-cite>, or a specific economic outlook <d-cite key="nyman2021news, ahrens2021extracting, handlan2020text"></d-cite>.</p> <h2 id="social-media-narratives-𝕏">Social Media Narratives 𝕏</h2> <p>We have collected<d-footnote>Data is available through the Social Media Archive (SOMAR): "https://socialmediaarchive.org/record/77".</d-footnote> two comprehensive datasets of tweets from Twitter (X), a platform chosen for its real-time reflection of public opinions and ability to capture diverse economic narratives. These datasets cover a broad time-frame, and a wide range of topics relevant to the economy, including economics, business, politics, and current events, ensuring a broad and comprehensive representation of narratives.</p> <p>Both datasets were carefully curated using targeted queries with the inclusion of specific keywords, and were analyzed to ensure quality and relevant for capturing economic narratives.</p> <p><strong>Pre-Pandemic Twitter Dataset:</strong> Utilizing Twitter API <d-cite key="Twitter-API"></d-cite>, we collected 2.4 million tweets from Twitter’s early days (January 2007) to COVID-19 pandemic (December 2020). To prioritize viral tweets, we retrieved the daily top 200 tweets based on follower count, then we randomly sampled 100 to mitigate potential bias towards highly active accounts typically associated with news outlets. This process yielded a dataset contributed by about 250,000 users per collected topic, each boasting an average follower count of 100 million, including global leaders, news outlets and other influencers.</p> <p><strong>Post-2021 Twitter Dataset:</strong> We wanted to test the predictive power of our employed LLM (OpenAI’s Chat Completion API with GPT-3.5 <d-cite key="ChatGPT-3.5"></d-cite>) on a timeframe beyond the LLM’s data cutoff date (September 2021). Therefore, we collected a second dataset ranging from September 2021 until July 2023. This assures the LLM relies solely on provided tweets and pre-existing knowledge, unaware of ‘future’ knowledge. Here we collected the tweets monthly, using Twitter Advanced Search, restricting the search to users with at least 1,000 followers. Overall we curated 2,881 tweets <d-footnote>As this data collection method is more restricted than the previous, the resulting dataset is relatively smaller.</d-footnote>, contributed by 1,255 users, including politicians, CEOs, activists, and academics.</p> <p>An example tweet can be:</p> <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"> <div class="jekyll-twitter-plugin"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is so silly.

The FFR serves as a Federal Reserve monetary policy tool, is influenced by public perception of economic stability, and its fluctuations impact various sectors, making it widely monitored.</p> <p><strong>S&amp;P 500:</strong> A stock market index measuring the performance of the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. It reflects collective investor confidence in economic growth and risk appetite and is widely regarded as a barometer of the overall health of the US stock market.</p> <p><strong>CBOE Volatility Index (VIX):</strong> Measures market expectations of future volatility based on S&amp;P 500 options prices, often referred to as the ‘fear gauge’ as it tends to rise during market stress and fall during market stability.</p> <p>These indicators are well-suited for testing the predictive power of narratives in macroeconomics due to their daily frequency, which aligns with the rapid pace of Twitter, and their sensitivity to public sentiment and behavior.</p> <hr> <h1 id="connecting-the-dots-testing-the-effectiveness-of-narratives-for-macroeconomic-forecasting">Connecting the Dots: Testing the Effectiveness of Narratives for Macroeconomic Forecasting</h1> <p>The previous two sections discussed the theory of Narrative Economics and our curated Twitter dataset, which holds narratives within them, and the distinction between macroeconomics and microeconomics, explaining why it is interesting to research the theory at the macroeconomic level and which macroeconomic indicators we chose.</p> <p>We can now delve into the series of experiments we tested to assess the central question - <strong>can economic narratives provide valuable insights for future macroeconomic movements?</strong></p> <p>Each experiment tests the predictive power of narratives from the curated datasets, for macroeconomic prediction of one (or more) of the financial targets introduced before: FFR, S&amp;P 500, and VIX.</p> <p>We won’t be able to cover all the details of the experiments in this blog, but it is available in our paper <d-cite key="gueta2024can"></d-cite>.</p> <h2 id="experimental-setup">Experimental Setup</h2> <h3 id="prediction-tasks">Prediction Tasks</h3> <p>We test the predictive power of narratives on three tasks commonly used in macroeconomic literature <d-cite key="handlan2020text, 10.1257/jel.20181020, kalamara2022making, ahrens2021extracting, masciandaro2021monetary, lee2009federal, hamilton2002model, kim2023forecasting, larkin2008good"></d-cite>:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Next value:</strong> Predicts the target’s value at the specified horizon.</li> <li> <strong>Percentage change:</strong> Predicts the target’s percentage change between the specified horizon and the day before.</li> <li> <strong>Direction change:</strong> Classifies the target’s direction of change (increase or decrease) between the specified horizon and the day before.</li> </ul> <h3 id="models-categories">Models Categories</h3> <p>We divide our models into 3 categories based on their input signal:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Financial (F):</strong> Utilizes historical financial data, from the past week or month.</li> <li> <strong>Textual (T):</strong> Leverages solely textual data, either raw tweets or tweets’ analyses.</li> <li> <strong>Textual &amp; Financial (TF):</strong> Draws upon both textual and financial data as input.</li> </ul> <p>Our goal is to effectively leverage insights from both textual narratives and historical financial patterns to improve prediction accuracy.

Economic markets are inherently complex and involve randomness, making accurate short-term prediction a significant challenge. The Efficient Market Hypothesis suggests that the predictive power of nowcasting is limited as asset prices react instantly to public information. However, Narrative Economics theory proposes that narratives affect people’s decisions, potentially giving us an edge in predicting economic fluctuations <d-cite key="shiller2017narrative"></d-cite>.</p> <p>We only looked at a few specific economic variables (FFR, S&amp;P 500, and VIX), influenced and shifted by diverse, external, and unobserved sources. Looking at different targets, or trying other tasks like detecting market anomalies or predicting profit, might have shown stronger evidence of the impact of narratives on the economy.</p> <p>The challenge of timing: When does a narrative actually start to impact the market, and for how long? Does it take hours, days, weeks? Although comprehensive, our experiments only examined a limited set of time lags and prediction horizons.</p> <p>What IS a Narrative?: While our datasets were carefully curated to capture potential narratives, definitively identifying them is challenging, especially when trying to aggregate multiple narratives for a holistic economic picture. The definition of “narrative” itself is broad and subjective, often only becoming clear in retrospect. This, combined with the inherent noise, biases, and misinformation common on social media, makes extracting clear, reliable narratives a complex task.</p> <p>Our worldview: Our analysis relies on English-language data from Twitter and focused on US-centric macroeconomic indicators. Narratives and economies work differently around the world and on different social media platforms or other outlets. This is definitely an area for future expansion.</p> <p>Lastly, we are limited to publicly accessible LLMs with a known cutoff date to ensure the models couldn’t “cheat” by accessing future knowledge. However, utilizing different models might lead to better results.</p> <p>A quick word on ethics: This research involves technology aimed at predicting human and economic behavior. It’s vital to state clearly that this kind of tech could be misused in harmful or unfair ways (e.g., for market manipulation or unfair practices). We strongly believe it needs to be developed and used with caution and constant awareness of its ethical implications.</p> <hr> <p><br></p> <p><em>This blogpost extends the technical experiments presented in our paper <d-cite key="gueta2024can"></d-cite>, delving deeper into broader aspects that naturally in a paper can only receive a shorter discussion as it primarily presents the technical results.
