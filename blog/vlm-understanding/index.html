These advancements have driven innovation in diverse fields, such as virtual assistants <d-cite key="wu2023visual"></d-cite>, autonomous robotics <d-cite key="driess2023palme"></d-cite>, and medical diagnostics <d-cite key="singhal2023towards"></d-cite>. However, despite their rapid adoption, the internal mechanisms of these models remain largely opaque, raising significant concerns about their reliability, robustness, and interpretability—particularly in high-stakes applications <d-cite key="kolicic2024inherently"></d-cite>.</p> <p>Interpretability research offers a promising path to address these challenges. Mechanistic interpretability, in particular, seeks to uncover the inner processes of neural networks and explain how specific outputs are generated <d-cite key="saphra2024mechanistic,hastingswoodhouse2024introduction"></d-cite>. By applying these techniques to VLMs, researchers can gain valuable insights into how these models represent, process, store, and integrate visual and linguistic information, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical utility.</p> <p>In this work, we examine how mechanistic interpretability methods can illuminate the inner workings of VLMs. We review five key techniques—probing <d-cite key="alain2016understanding,hewitt-manning-2019-structural"></d-cite>, activation patching <d-cite key="NEURIPS2020_92650b2e, NEURIPS2022_6f1d43d5"></d-cite>, logit lens <d-cite key="alignmentforumorg2024interpreting"></d-cite>, sparse autoencoders <d-cite key="bricken2023monosemanticity,DBLP:conf/iclr/HubenCRES24"></d-cite>, and automated explanations <d-cite key="singh2023explaining,bills2023language"></d-cite>—detailing their mechanisms, applications, and the insights they provide through concrete examples. These methods help answer critical questions, such as what information is encoded in VLM representations <d-cite key="cao2020behind"></d-cite>, how and when visual and linguistic modalities are integrated <d-cite key="Palit_2023_ICCV,neo2024towards"></d-cite>, and how individual neurons contribute to the model’s decision-making process <d-cite key="huo2024mmneuron,huang2024miner"></d-cite>.</p> <p>Additionally, we discuss the limitations of current interpretability methods and highlight five key directions for future research: developing approaches that are more generalizable, scalable, vision-centric, dynamic, and capable of macro-level analysis. For instance, the heterogeneity of VLMs calls for interpretability methods that can adapt across diverse models; the micro level of mechanistic interpretability needs to be complemented by a macro-level perspective for a broader understanding.

It helps researchers identify <strong>whether specific types of information are encoded within the model</strong> by training auxiliary classifiers—referred to as probes—on the model’s intermediate outputs. This method is particularly useful for understanding what a model has learned and how it organizes information across its layers.</p> <h3 id="how-probing-works">How Probing Works</h3> <p>Probing involves training supervised classifiers, typically simple ones like linear probes, to predict specific properties from the internal representations of a model. These properties can include linguistic, visual, or multimodal features. The probe’s performance indicates whether the target information is accessible in the model’s representations:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>High accuracy</strong>: Suggests the property is well-encoded.</li> <li> <strong>Low accuracy</strong>: Indicates the property may be absent or deeply entangled.</li> </ul> <p>Linear probes are often preferred because their simplicity ensures that high accuracy reflects the quality of the model’s representations, rather than the complexity of the probe itself <d-cite key="belinkov2021probing"></d-cite>.</p> <details> <summary><b>Example</b></summary> <p>To illustrate, consider a vision language model analyzing the caption: <em>“A cat sitting on a mat.”</em></p> <ul> <li>A probe could be trained to predict spatial relationships (e.g., object positioning) from intermediate representations of the model.</li> <li>Another probe might predict visual attributes, such as “furry” or “striped,” encoded in the text embeddings.</li> </ul> <p>If the probe achieves high accuracy, it suggests that these properties (spatial relationships or visual attributes) are captured in the model’s representations. If accuracy is low, the information may be missing or insufficiently disentangled to be easily accessed.</p> </details> <p><br></p> <h3 id="key-findings-from-existing-works">Key Findings from Existing Works</h3> <p>Most research on probing tasks in VLMs focuses on two primary objectives: <strong>identifying the concepts these models struggle to capture</strong> and <strong>assessing the relative importance of visual and linguistic modalities</strong> <d-cite key="golovanevsky2024vlms"></d-cite>.</p> <p>Cao et al. <d-cite key="cao2020behind"></d-cite> introduced the VALUE (Vision-And-Language Understanding Evaluation) framework, which developed a set of probing tasks to explain individual layers, heads, and fusion techniques. This study reveals several important insights: pre-trained models often prioritize language over vision in multimodal tasks (<strong>modality prioritization</strong>); specific attention heads are effective at capturing interactions between visual and linguistic modalities (<strong>cross-modal interactions</strong>); and visualization of attention mechanisms has revealed interpretable relationships, such as object-object interactions in images (<strong>attention visualization</strong>).</p> <p>Studies have also explored diverse model capabilities, such as visual semantics <d-cite key="dahlgren-lindstrom-etal-2020-probing"></d-cite>, verb processing <d-cite key="hendricks2021probing,beňová2024beyond"></d-cite>, numerical reasoning <d-cite key="kajic2022probing"></d-cite>, and spatial reasoning <d-cite key="pantazopoulos2024lost"></d-cite>.

These tools have greatly enhanced our understanding of how VLMs represent, integrate, and process multimodal information. Despite these advancements, several key challenges remain. These include the need for validation across a wider range of VLM architectures and training paradigms, a deeper exploration of information flow dynamics throughout training stages, and a stronger alignment between micro-level insights and macro-level behaviors. Addressing these challenges will pave the way for developing more robust and effective VLMs, advancing both their design and practical applications.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> </div> <d-bibliography src="/2025/assets/bibliography/2025-04-28-vlm-understanding.bib"></d-bibliography> <d-article id="bibtex-container" class="related highlight"> For attribution in academic contexts, please cite this work as <pre id="bibtex-academic-attribution">
