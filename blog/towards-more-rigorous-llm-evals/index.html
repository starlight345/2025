Conclusion</a></div> </nav> </d-contents> <h1 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h1> <p>A staggering volume of research papers on (large) language models (LMs) is published daily. On the day of writing this (5th Nov 2024), 239 papers containing “LLM” or “Language Model” in their titles were added to the Computer Science section of arXiv alone. This flood of publications makes it difficult to separate genuine insights from noise, especially in areas lacking precise definitions, such as “reasoning”. Given the empirical nature of LLM research, much is open to interpretation, making rigorous analysis crucial to reduce bias and improve the reliability of findings.</p> <p>In this post, we argue that LM researchers—especially those working in areas where core concepts lack established definitions—must adopt statistical methods to improve the rigor of their empirical evaluations. Leveraging techniques from classical statistics, such as confidence intervals and hypothesis tests, will help move the field beyond anecdotal observations and philosophical arguments toward a more scientific understanding of model behaviour.</p> <p>To illustrate this in practice, we outline three key elements of rigorous empirical evaluation and apply them to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05229" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mirzadeh et al. (2024)</a> <d-cite key="mirzadeh2024gsm"></d-cite>—a recent paper that examines whether LMs perform “formal reasoning” or rely on “sophisticated pattern matching”.</p> <h1 id="2-elements-of-rigorous-empirical-evaluation">2. Elements of Rigorous Empirical Evaluation</h1> <p>We believe that the following three elements are key to rigorous empirical evaluation, especially when dealing with relatively small evaluation datasets (e.g., at the order of 100-1000 samples):</p> <ol> <li>Clear articulation of assumptions and consideration of alternative explanations.</li> <li>Quantification of uncertainty in results through appropriate statistical measures.</li> <li>Careful consideration of train-test overlap, with reasonable attempts to evaluate on “out-of-sample” datasets when possible.</li> </ol> <blockquote> <p>If one does not give thought to what the data would be like under the assumption that one’s theory is false, one is likely reinforcing confirmation bias rather than establishing the validity of the theory. <em>“Reproducibility, p-values, and type III errors: response to Mayo”, Philip B. Stark (2022) <d-cite key="stark2022reproducibility"></d-cite></em></p> </blockquote> <p>The first step in rigorous evaluation is to clarify assumptions and explore alternative explanations. Experiments can often be designed in ways that unintentionally favour the hypothesis being tested. By being upfront about assumptions, questioning their validity, and investigating alternative explanations, researchers will improve the reliability and robustness of their conclusions.</p> <blockquote> <p>In some sense it [the p-value] offers a first line of defence against being fooled by randomness, separating signal from noise […]. <em>“It’s Not the P-Values’ Fault”, Yoav Benjamini (2016) <d-cite key="benjamini2016not"></d-cite></em></p> </blockquote> <p>A second essential step is quantifying uncertainty, using tools such as error bars and confidence intervals, which help us gauge the reliability of performance metrics by providing a range of plausible values. Additionally, although often criticised, hypothesis tests and p-values can serve as an initial, coarse filter to distinguish signal from noise, laying the groundwork for deeper exploration into the practical significance of the reported results.</p> <p>Finally, evaluating models on entirely unseen (“out-of-sample”) data is essential for accurately assessing their true capabilities. Unfortunately, identifying the extent of train-test overlap in LMs is both difficult and often neglected. Many language models are not transparent about this issue, and benchmark datasets frequently get <em>leaked</em> (or <em>contaminated</em>) during training, leading to biased evaluations and inflated performance metrics (<d-cite key="zhang2024language"></d-cite>, Zhang et al. 2024). As Zhang et al. (2024) highlight, reporting train-test overlap statistics is crucial for ensuring the validity of model evaluations.</p> <p>To illustrate these three principles, we use <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05229" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mirzadeh et al. (2024)</a> as a case study—a recent paper that received substantial attention from the LLM research community with <strong>millions of views</strong> across social media platforms and the world-wide-web (e.g. see <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/gsm-symbolic" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1g1zphu/apple_ai_researchers_question_openais_claims/" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this</a>, or <a href="https://x.com/MFarajtabar/status/1844456880971858028" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this</a>). We review their methods, identify gaps in their analysis, and offer a more rigorous statistical assessment of their claims.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Whilst writing this blog post, a great overview of statistical methods suitable for evaluating LMs was published by Miller (2024) <d-cite key="miller2024adding"></d-cite>.</p> <h1 id="3-summary-of-mirzadeh-et-al-2024">3. Summary of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05229" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mirzadeh et al. (2024)</a> </h1> <p>Mirzadeh et al. (2024) <d-cite key="mirzadeh2024gsm"></d-cite> make two technical contributions: (1) a new benchmark, called GSM-Symbolic, for evaluating mathematical reasoning of LMs, and (2) an empirical evaluation of 25 LMs on this new benchmark to assess their reasoning capabilities.</p> <h2 id="31-what-is-the-new-benchmark-and-how-is-it-constructed">3.1 What is the new benchmark and how is it constructed?</h2> <p>The authors propose GSM-Symbolic, a variant of the well-established GSM8K benchmark for grade school math word problems <d-cite key="cobbe2021training"></d-cite>. Since GSM8K has likely leaked into many LMs’ training sets due to its popularity, GSM-Symbolic aims to match its distribution whilst eliminating (or reducing) train-test overlap.</p> <p>The authors also construct four variants of GSM-Symbolic by modifying question difficulty:</p> <ul> <li>GSM-M1: An easier version that removes one clause from each question.</li> <li>GSM-P1 and GSM-P2: Progressively harder versions that add one or two extra clauses respectively.</li> <li>GSM-NoOp: A version that adds “seemingly relevant but ultimately irrelevant information” that should have no operational significance (NoOp).</li> </ul> <p>To generate GSM-Symbolic and the variants, the authors create “templates” from GSM8K questions by identifying modifiable variables whilst preserving the underlying logic. Each variable has a specified domain and constraints to ensure valid questions and answers. Here’s an example template:</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-towards-more-rigorous-llm-evals/template_gsm-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-towards-more-rigorous-llm-evals/template_gsm-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-towards-more-rigorous-llm-evals/template_gsm-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-towards-more-rigorous-llm-evals/template_gsm.png" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture><figcaption class="caption"><b>Figure 1 from Mirzadeh et al. (2024) <d-cite key="mirzadeh2024gsm"></d-cite>.</b></figcaption> </figure> <p>For their analysis, the authors select 100 questions from GSM8K and create such a template for each of them. Whilst the paper does not specify their selection method, we think that these questions were sampled randomly from GSM8K’s test set. By sampling values for the variables, 50 new questions are generated from each template. This means that GSM-Symbolic and each of its 4 variants (GSM-M1, GSM-P1, GSM-P2, and GSM-NoOp) contain <strong>50 datasets of 100 questions each</strong>.</p> <p>Throughout this post, when we refer to “GSM8K”, we specifically mean those 100 original GSM8K questions that were used to create the templates, not the full GSM8K dataset.</p> <h2 id="32-what-are-the-key-findings-and-conclusions-from-the-empirical-evaluation">3.2 What are the key findings and conclusions from the empirical evaluation?</h2> <p>The evaluated model families include Gemma, Phi, Mistral and Llama (open weights), and GPT and o1 (proprietary, OpenAI). Of the open weights models, one can be considered “medium” size (Gemma2 27B params), and all the rest can be considered “small” (9B params or less). The metrics reported are average accuracy across the 50 versions of each dataset and the standard deviation of these accuracies.</p> <p>The key findings are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Performance variability: LMs exhibit some variability in performance across different instantiations of the same question.</p> </li> <li> <p>Performance decline: Compared to GSM8K, performance on GSM-Symbolic drops, suggesting potential data contamination.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sensitivity to question complexity: As complexity of the questions increases, “the performance [of models] decreases and the variance increases”, which is said to suggest that “models are not performing formal reasoning”, and that the increase in variance is “in line with the pattern-matching hypothesis”.</p> </li> <li> <p>Impact of irrelevant information: Introducing a clause of no operational significance (NoOp), leads to large performance degradation across models, suggesting “deeper issues in their reasoning processes”.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The paper concludes that LMs “are not performing formal reasoning”.</p> <h1 id="4-critical-analysis-and-re-evaluation">4. Critical analysis and re-evaluation</h1> <p><strong>Note 1:</strong> We provide a rigorous description of the mathematical framework which we use to analyse the results from Mirzadeh et al. (2024) in the Appendix.</p> <p><strong>Note 2:</strong> We run some additional small-scale experiments to provide empirical evidence for the claims we make in this post. We use two of the models that were evaluated in the paper: Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Phi-3.5-mini-Instruct. All code will be made available on GitHub.</p> <h2 id="41-performance-variability-why-is-variability-not-that-interesting">4.1 Performance variability: Why is variability not (that) interesting?</h2> <blockquote> <p>As demonstrated, all models show a <strong>significant variance</strong> across different sets. […] It is <strong>noteworthy that this variation even occurs</strong> […]. <d-cite key="mirzadeh2024gsm"></d-cite>, emphasis added.</p> </blockquote> <p>The authors emphasise the “non-negligible variance” in model performance across different GSM-Symbolic datasets, framing it as surprising. But is it?</p> <h3 id="411-when-is-variability-not-expected">4.1.1 When is variability <em>not expected</em>?</h3> <p>Variability would indeed be unexpected if each resampled question was effectively the same as the original. The implicit assumption here is that if an LM solves (or fails to solve) a given question once, it should always solve (or fail to solve) it when presented with the same problem but with different numbers. In other words, this assumes that LMs never make arithmetic mistakes—a very strong assumption that is not examined or addressed in the paper.</p> <p><strong>Is this assumption valid?</strong> For humans, it clearly is not. Even when solving the same problem with different numbers or subjects, humans can make (non-reasoning related) errors, such as arithmetic mistakes or copying a number incorrectly. The same applies to LMs.</p> <p>We demonstrate this empirically by looking at the performance of LMs on a basic addition task with varying <strong>digit lengths</strong> (e.g. “What is 147 + 562?”). Consistent with prior literature (see e.g. <d-cite key="muffo2023evaluating"></d-cite>, <d-cite key="yuan2023well"></d-cite>), we find that as the numbers get larger, accuracy declines, thus showing that simple arithmetic is not perfectly reliable. We go beyond digit length and also consider how the number of <strong>carry operations</strong> affects performance on this simple addition task. The figure below illustrates how the probability of answering a question correctly is affected by the number of digits $d$ of the numbers being added and the number of carry operations involved in the sum.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-towards-more-rigorous-llm-evals/addition_accuracy-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-towards-more-rigorous-llm-evals/addition_accuracy-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-towards-more-rigorous-llm-evals/addition_accuracy-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-towards-more-rigorous-llm-evals/addition_accuracy.png" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto" title="Accuracy of Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Phi-3.5-mini-instruct on a simple addition task" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture><figcaption class="caption"><b>Accuracy of Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Phi-3.5-mini-instruct on a simple addition task of adding two $d$-digit numbers.</b> The plot illustrates how the probability of answering a question correctly ($y$-axis) is affected by the total number of digits involved ($2d$, $x$-axis), and the total number of carry operations involved in that sum (colour of the points). Point size reflects the total number of tokens (for Phi, total digits equal total tokens; for Llama, numbers up to 3 digits are 1 token and up to 6 digits are 2 tokens). For this illustration, we group questions by number of digits and carry operations, and plot the average accuracy over 512 samples. Groups containing fewer than 10 questions are excluded. Detailed results of the logistic regressions are available in the Appendix.</figcaption> </figure> <p>The regression results indicate that LM performance is negatively affected by both the number of digits and the number of carry operations in the sum. In other words, as the numbers get larger and the number of carry operations increases, accuracy declines. This suggests that LMs make errors similar to those made by humans, such as forgetting carry operations. Detailed regression results can be found in the Appendix.</p> <p><strong>Is performing arithmetic part of reasoning?</strong> Solving a math word problem consists of two steps: (1) translating the text to a sequence of operations, and (2) performing the operations correctly. Whilst the first step clearly requires reasoning ability, we argue that the second is more mechanical in nature and should not be considered as part of reasoning. To isolate “pure reasoning” capabilities, models could be provided with a calculator, which would help reduce (though not completely eliminate) the confounding effect of arithmetic errors.</p> <h3 id="412-when-is-variability-expected">4.1.2 When is variability <em>expected</em>?</h3> <p>If we (rightfully) reject the assumption that LMs are infallible in arithmetic, performance variability across datasets becomes entirely expected. Even if a model applies consistent reasoning, it may still make arithmetic errors, leading to natural performance variation.</p> <p><strong>How much variation is expected?</strong><br> By now, it should be clear that the answer to this question depends on the assumptions we make about the data. One reasonable assumption we could make is that each model \(m=1, \dots, 25\), answers a question from template \(t=1,\dots,100\) correctly with some probability \(p_{m,t}\) (where the randomness is induced by the sampling of different filler values; see the Appendix for a precise mathematical treatment of our assumptions). Unfortunately, since the paper does not provide performance data for individual question templates, we will focus our analysis instead on the quantity \(p_m\), obtained by marginalising \(p_{m,t}\) across templates.</p> <p>Thus, an LM answering questions is modelled as an independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trial with a model-specific success probability \(p_m\). Under this assumption, the total number of correct answers on a dataset of size \(N=100\) is</p> \[\text{Binomial}(N, p_m).\] <p>The variance of this distribution is <strong>fully determined by the success probability \(p_m\)</strong> and equals</p> \[N \cdot p_m \cdot (1-p_m).\] <p>This variance is maximised when $p_m=1/2$ and goes to $0$ as $p_m$ approaches $0$ or $1$.</p> <p>To understand what “expected” variation means under our assumption, we can construct confidence intervals (CIs) for the point estimates of $p_m$ on the GSM8K dataset. We highlight that the paper does not report such point estimates, but we can calculate the maximum likelihood estimates of $p_m$ by dividing the number of correct answers by the total number of questions. The number of correct answers (out of 100 questions) on the GSM8K questions are reported in the second column of Table 1 in the Appendix of the paper. We denote this estimate as \(\hat{p}^{8K}_{m}\) to indicate that it is computed from the GSM8K dataset.</p> <p>There are different ways to construct CI for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Binomial proportion</a>.

To put this variability into perspective, we also include the average of the 50 point estimates for the model performance on GSM-Symbolic, which we denote as \(\overline{\hat{p}^{Symb}_{m}}\). <d-footnote>Similarly to $\hat{p}^{8K}_{m}$, we obtain maximum likelihood estimates of $\overline{\hat{p}^{Symb}_{m}}}$ from the average accuracy on GSM-Symbolic, reported in Table 1 of the paper.</d-footnote></p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-towards-more-rigorous-llm-evals/wilson_0.95-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-towards-more-rigorous-llm-evals/wilson_0.95-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-towards-more-rigorous-llm-evals/wilson_0.95-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-towards-more-rigorous-llm-evals/wilson_0.95.png" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto" title="95% Wilson score confidence intervals" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture><figcaption class="caption"><b>95% Wilson score confidence intervals for the point estimates of $\hat{p}^{8K}_{m}$ (red dots), along with the average (over 50 datasets) point estimate of $\overline{\hat{p}^{Symb}_{m}}$ (blue triangles).</b> The point estimates of $\hat{p}^{8K}_{m}$ and $\overline{\hat{p}^{Symb}_{m}}$ are estimated from the data reported in Table 1 of the Appendix of Mirzadeh et al.

This discrepancy is likely to be explained by the unmodelled correlations between answers to questions coming from the same template—as initially suggested, a more reasonable assumption would be to model the probability of success on a template level, $p_{m,t}$, rather than assuming that questions arising from different templates are equally likely to be answered correctly. The analysis can be repeated once (if) the detailed question-level data becomes available.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> The observed variability in GSM-Symbolic performance is not inherently surprising, and we provide empirical evidence that it is indeed expected. </p> <h2 id="42-performance-decline-on-gsm-symbolic">4.2 Performance decline on GSM-Symbolic</h2> <p>The paper claims that LMs perform worse on GSM-Symbolic compared to GSM8K. Let’s examine the evidence presented in Section 4.1, which we quote directly:</p> <blockquote> <p>Another noteworthy observation is that the performance (represented by the dashed line in Fig. 2) on the original questions from the 100 examples of GSM8K used as templates is <strong>often more than one standard deviation away from the center</strong> of the GSM-Symbolic performance distribution, frequently on the right side of the distribution (this holds for 21 out of 25 models). <strong>One explanation</strong> for this could be data contamination […]. <d-cite key="mirzadeh2024gsm"></d-cite>, emphasis added.</p> </blockquote> <p>There are two issues with the above quote. First, the authors suggest data contamination as one possible explanation for the performance decline, but do not explore other plausible explanations. Second, they rely on a hand-wavy “one standard deviation” criterion to suggest that the decline in performance is significant, without proper statistical analysis. We address both of these next.</p> <h3 id="421-alternative-explanation-distribution-mismatch">4.2.1 Alternative explanation: Distribution mismatch</h3> <p>In addition to data contamination, another plausible explanation for the alleged performance discrepancy is a distribution mismatch between GSM8K and GSM-Symbolic. We note that the two explanations are not mutually exclusive—both can be true at the same time and should be evaluated appropriately.</p> <p>The paper does not examine or discuss the potential distribution mismatch, making it impossible to draw definitive conclusions without access to the templates used. However, there is evidence indicating that the distribution of GSM-Symbolic questions differs from that of GSM8K, and that GSM-Symbolic is indeed more difficult. Looking at the example template (Figure 1 from the paper, reproduced above), we see that the sampling ranges for some variables <strong>exclude</strong> the original GSM8K values:</p> <ul> <li>The variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">total</code> is sampled from $(100, 500)$, whilst in the original question we have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">total=62</code>.</li> <li>The variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ans</code> is sampled from $(85, 200)$, whilst in the original question we have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ans=14</code>.</li> </ul> <p>In other words, the original GSM8K question cannot be generated from the sampling ranges in the Symbolic template of Figure 1. In the next table, we propose more suitable ranges for all variables in the symbolic template, that ensure that the original question can be reproduced.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Variable</th> <th>Symbolic range</th> <th>Proposed range (ours)</th> <th>Original value</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">total</code> (toys)</td> <td>$(100, 500)$</td> <td>$(10, 100)$</td> <td>$62$</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> (building blocks)</td> <td>$(5, 100)$</td> <td>$(4, 40)$</td> <td>$31$</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code> (stuffed animals)</td> <td>$(5, 100)$</td> <td>$(1, 20)$</td> <td>$8$</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">z</code> (stacking rings)</td> <td>$(5, 100)$</td> <td>$(1, 20)$</td> <td>$9$</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ans</code> (bouncy balls)</td> <td>$(85, 200)$</td> <td>$(4, 40)$</td> <td>$14$</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <div class="caption"> <b>The GSM-Symbolic sampling ranges for the variables from Figure 1 in Mirzadeh et al.

We also believe that the proposed ranges better align with the context of the variables (e.g. having between 4 and 40 bouncy balls is more realistic than having between 85 and 200). </div> <p>Since accuracy decreases as the number of digits in arithmetic operations increases (as discussed in Section 4.1.1), we expect that our proposed smaller ranges would result in higher accuracy compared to the original template, assuming that the reasoning process is executed correctly.</p> <p>The question in Figure 1 involves three arithmetic operations: two additions and one subtraction. Assuming that subtraction is as difficult as addition, the probability of getting all three operations correct is the product of the individual probabilities of each operation being answered correctly.</p> <p>To quantify the difference in accuracy that might arise from using the ranges in the paper versus the ranges we propose, we apply the logistic regression model from Section 4.1.1. Specifically, we consider the operations $(x+y)$, $(x+y)+z$, and $(x+y+z)+ans$ as the three operations to directly apply our model.</p> <p>We present the results for Phi-3.5-mini-instruct and Llama3-8b-instruct in the next two tables, reporting the mean and standard deviation over 512 samples.

In contrast, for the Phi-3.5-mini-instruct model, the effect is substantially larger: the probability of correctly performing all 3 operations is $86.6\%$ with our proposed ranges, compared to $82.1\%$ with the symbolic ranges—a difference of $4.5$ percentage points. Interestingly, this difference is similar to the performance drop observed for this model on the GSM8K vs the GSM-Symbolic datasets, which is $5.9$ percentage points ($88.0\%$ on GSM8K vs $82.1\%$ on GSM-Symbolic).</p> <p>Based on the analysis for this question template, we argue that even if the models execute the “reasoning” process perfectly, i.e. they are able to correctly translate the math word problem into a sequence of arithmetic operations, they would still perform worse on the Symbolic template compared to our proposed template. Extrapolating from this, we suggest that if similar systematic discrepancies are present in other templates, then some (for some models likely substantial) portion of the observed performance decline could be attributed to an increased frequency of arithmetic errors.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Using this analysis, we can conclude that the probability of successfully performing all arithmetic operations decreases exponentially as the number of arithmetic operations increases (more on this in Section 4.3). </p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> We provide some evidence for the existence of a distribution mismatch between GSM8K and GSM-Symbolic, which we believe should be further investigated. This mismatch could explain (some of) the performance discrepancies, and we offer some empirical support for this claim.

To determine if this trend is statistically significant, we use the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, which is a non-parametric paired difference test.<d-footnote>The careful reader would notice that in the previous subsection, we used parametric tests. This was because we do not have access to question-level data which is necessary for a non-parametric test. We would prefer non-parametric tests as they do not rely on distributional assumptions. </d-footnote></p> <p>Before applying the test, we acknowledge two caveats and attempt to address them.</p> <p><strong>Caveat 1: Non-independent data.</strong> It is incorrect to perform the test on all 25 models because they are not independent. There are several types of dependence to consider. Most notably, base models and their instruct-tuned versions are related (e.g., Gemma2-9b and Gemma2-9b-it). Additionally, we believe that different sizes within the same model family are not independent (e.g., mini-small-medium for Phi or 2b-9b-27b for Gemma). Minor version updates (e.g., Mistral v0.1 vs. 0.3, Phi 3 vs. 3.5) are also likely correlated. So, although we have a sample of 25 models, the effective sample size is much smaller.</p> <p>To address this, we have attempted to create sets of independent models and perform the test on these subsets. In each model family, we selected the <em>latest, largest instruct-tuned version</em> and repeated this process by also selecting the <em>smallest</em> version. This gives us two sets of 7 models, with differences between the two sets indicated in italics:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Subset of <strong>largest</strong> models: <em>Gemma2-27b-it</em>, Phi-3.5-mini-instruct, Mistral-7b-instruct-v0.3, Mathstral-7b-v0.1, Llama3-8b-instruct, <em>GPT-4o</em>, <em>o1-preview</em>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Subset of <strong>smallest</strong> models: <em>Gemma2-2b-it</em>, Phi-3.5-mini-instruct, Mistral-7b-instruct-v0.3, Mathstral-7b-v0.1, Llama3-8b-instruct, <em>GPT-4o-mini</em>, <em>o1-mini</em>.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Caveat 2: Different sample sizes.</strong> We note that the success probability on GSM8K is estimated from only one sample (of 100 questions) and the success probability on GSM-Symbolic is estimated from 50 samples (each containing 100 questions). Whilst the test is valid, inaccurate measurements of the estimated success probabilities would lead to invalid conclusions.</p> <p>Let’s define the vectors of success probabilities on GSM8K and GSM-Symbolic as \(p^{8K}_{\text{subset}}=[p^{8K}_{1}, \dots, p^{8K}_{7}]\) and \(p^{Symb}_{\text{subset}}= [p^{Symb}_{1}, \dots, p^{Symb}_{7}]\), where the subscript \(\text{subset} \in \{\text{largest}, \text{smallest}\}\). As before, we perform one-sided and two-sided tests:</p> <ul> <li>Two-sided: The success probabilities are different</li> </ul> \[H_0: p^{8K}_{\text{subset}} = p^{Symb}_{\text{subset}} \quad\quad\quad H_A^\text{two-sided}: p^{8K}_{\text{subset}} \neq p^{Symb}_{\text{subset}}.\] <ul> <li>One-sided: The success probability on GSM8K is greater than that on GSM-Symbolic</li> </ul> \[H_0: p^{8K}_{\text{subset}} = p^{Symb}_{\text{subset}} \quad\quad\quad H_A^\text{one-sided}: p^{8K}_{\text{subset}} &gt; p^{Symb}_{\text{subset}}.\] <p>The results of the hypothesis tests are given in the following table:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Subset of Models</th> <th>Two-sided p-value</th> <th>One-sided p-value</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Largest</strong></td> <td>0.047</td> <td>0.023</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Smallest</strong></td> <td>0.078</td> <td>0.039</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <div class="caption"> <b>Results of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for the two subsets of models.</b> At the $5\%$ significance level, there is evidence of statistically significant differences in performance between GSM8K and GSM-Symbolic. </div> <p>For the <strong>largest</strong> subset of models, both tests show statistically significant differences (at the $5\%$ significance level but not at the $1\%$ level), indicating that GSM8K outperforms GSM-Symbolic in the one-sided test. When looking at the <strong>smallest</strong> subset of models, the evidence for significant differences is somewhat weaker.</p> <p>It is important to note that rejecting the null hypothesis gives us strong evidence that the models perform worse on GSM-Symbolic, but does not imply that the models lack reasoning abilities. As mentioned in Section 4.2.1, the observed performance differences could also be due to distributional differences (for which there is substantial evidence), data contamination, or a combination of both.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> When analysing the results of models individually, there is little evidence of performance differences: out of 25 models, only 3 perform significantly worse on GSM-Symbolic compared to GSM8K, and 1 performs better. When we analyse the results of models together, we find some, albeit weak, evidence that the models perform worse on GSM-Symbolic. These differences could be due to several factors, including distribution mismatch, data contamination, or lack of reasoning capabilities.</p> <h2 id="43-performance-decrease-and-variance-increase-with-question-complexity">4.3 Performance decrease and variance increase with question complexity</h2> <p>Mirzadeh et al.

Some examples include:</p> <blockquote> <p>[page 3] We show that performance degradation and variance increase as the number of clauses increases, indicating that LLMs’ reasoning capabilities struggle […]</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>[page 9, Figure 6 reproduced below] the distribution of performance shifts to the left (i.e., accuracy decreases), and the variance increases.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>[page 9] the increase in variance suggests that searching and pattern-matching become significantly harder for models as the difficulty increases.</p> </blockquote> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-towards-more-rigorous-llm-evals/fig6_gsm-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-towards-more-rigorous-llm-evals/fig6_gsm-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-towards-more-rigorous-llm-evals/fig6_gsm-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-towards-more-rigorous-llm-evals/fig6_gsm.png" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture><figcaption class="caption"><b>Figure 6 from Mirzadeh et al. (2024) <d-cite key="mirzadeh2024gsm"></d-cite>.</b> Note that the $x$-axis scales are different for different models.</figcaption> </figure> <p>The figure above shows the results for four datasets: the baseline GSM-Symbolic, GSM-M1 (Minus 1), which removes a clause, and GSM-P1 (Plus 1) and GSM-P2 (Plus 2), which add one and two clauses respectively. It is reasonable to expect that a model will perform better on easier datasets and worse on more difficult ones. As before, we assume that a model $m$ answers questions of varying difficulty levels \(\text{dif}=-1, 0, 1, 2\) as independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials with a success probability of \(p^{\text{dif}}_{m}\). The distribution of the total number of correct answers follows a binomial distribution \(\text{Bin}(N=100, p^\text{dif}_{m})\), with variance equal to \(N \cdot p^\text{dif}_{m} \cdot (1 - p^\text{dif}_{m})\).</p> <p>If the probabilities of success decrease with increasing question complexity, i.e. \(p^{\text{dif}=-1}_{m} &gt; p^{\text{dif}=0}_{m} &gt; p^{\text{dif}=1}_{m} &gt; p^{\text{dif}=2}_{m} &gt; 0.5\), the corresponding variances <em>must increase</em>.<d-footnote>We note that the average success probability on GSM-P2, $p^{\text{dif}=2}_{m}$, does fall below 0.5 for the models in the first row of Figure 6. Our point is still valid in these cases since $p^{\text{dif}=2}_{m}$ is closer to 0.5 than $p^{\text{dif}=1}_{m}$ and hence the variability on GSM-P2 is still expected to be larger than on GSM-P1. We would expect to see decrease in variance in cases where $0.5 &gt; p^{\text{dif}=-1}_{m} &gt; p^{\text{dif}=0}_{m} &gt; p^{\text{dif}=1}_{m} &gt; p^{\text{dif}=2}_{m}$.</d-footnote> We believe that this is precisely what we observe in Figure 6: the increase in variance is a trivial consequence of the decrease in probabilities of success, rather than a sign of “pattern-matching” becoming harder.</p> <p>Regarding the decrease in probability of success itself, it is plausible that reasoning becomes more challenging as additional clauses are introduced, or conversely, easier when clauses are removed, as seen in the M1 template. Importantly, as noted in Section 4.2.1, introducing more clauses necessarily involves more arithmetic operations, which in turn will result in an exponential decline in performance. This decline will occur even if the models perfectly execute the “reasoning” process of translating the math word problem into a sequence of arithmetic operations. To distinguish between these two effects, a more detailed and thorough analysis will be needed.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> The emphasis on “non-negligible variance” and “increase in variance” throughout the paper appears to be an over-interpretation of expected statistical artifacts. The decrease in probability of success as question complexity increases can be due to both increased difficulty in reasoning and increased probability of making an arithmetic mistake.</p> <h2 id="44-performance-decline-on-the-noop-dataset">4.4 Performance decline on the NoOp dataset</h2> <p>All models perform substantially worse on the NoOp dataset compared to GSM8K, as shown in Figure 8 (a) of the paper:</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-towards-more-rigorous-llm-evals/fig8_gsm-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-towards-more-rigorous-llm-evals/fig8_gsm-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-towards-more-rigorous-llm-evals/fig8_gsm-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-towards-more-rigorous-llm-evals/fig8_gsm.png" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture><figcaption class="caption"><b>Figure 8(a) from Mirzadeh et al.

Conclusion</h2> <p>There’s huge value in developing new benchmarks and we believe that the proposed GSM-Symbolic can be quite useful! The accompanying analysis, however, can be substantially improved with the help of basic statistics. The frequentist approach we adopt here is particularly well-suited, as the Symbolic templates allow us to generate an arbitrary number of new datasets<d-footnote>This is the Frequentist's dream! The alternative to Frequentism is Bayesian analysis, which we leave for another blog post.</d-footnote>.</p> <p>Key findings from each subsection are summarised below:</p> <ul> <li>[<strong>Section 4.1</strong>] We discussed the assumptions under which variability of performance on GSM-Symbolic is unexpected vs expected and quantifiable. We provided empirical evidence that variability is indeed expected.</li> <li>[<strong>Section 4.2</strong>] We argued that distribution mismatch between the GSM8K and GSM-Symbolic datasets may explain some of the observed performance decline of models (in addition to contamination and “lack of reasoning”). We also quantified the extent to which the performance degradation on GSM-Symbolic is actually statistically significant. Considering models individually, only 3 out of 25 models show a statistically significant performance decline on GSM-Symbolic (and 1 performs significantly better). Taken together, there is some evidence for a performance decline on GSM-Symbolic vs GSM8K.</li> <li>[<strong>Section 4.3</strong>] The observed increase in performance variance with rising question complexity is likely an over-interpretation of expected statistical artefacts. The decrease in success probability as complexity grows can be attributed to both increased reasoning difficulty and a higher likelihood of arithmetic errors. </li> <li>[<strong>Section 4.4</strong>] The performance decline on the GSM-NoOp dataset is highly statistically significant. We believe that investigating the NoOp results in more detail could provide genuine insights into the models’ reasoning capabilities. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Final thoughts:</strong> We strongly believe that without a rigorous statistical framework, there is a substantial risk of over-interpreting results and drawing misleading conclusions.<d-footnote>Neither the Frequentist nor the Bayesian religion is perfect, but neglecting statistical analysis altogether would be the worst outcome.</d-footnote> We hope that this blog post can serve as a tutorial and can help researchers to get into the habit of thinking about and performing proper statistical evaluations of LLMs!</p> <h1 id="appendix">Appendix</h1> <h2 id="mathematical-setup">Mathematical setup</h2> <p>Here we more rigorously describe the mathematical lens which we use to analyse the results from <d-cite key="mirzadeh2024gsm"></d-cite>. First, we assume that the questions from GSM8k and GSM-Symbolic are obtained from the following data-generating process:</p> <ol> <li>We sample a <em>template</em> \(T\) from some distribution \(\mathbb{P}_T\). A template here is defined in the sense of <d-cite key="mirzadeh2024gsm"></d-cite>, that is, it is a mathematical word problem, in which numerical values (e.g. number of toys) and certain other objects (e.g. names of people) are marked as variables, to be filled-in later.</li> <li>The template \(T\) gives rise to a conditional distribution \(\mathbb{P}_{V\vert T}\) over the admissible <em>filler-values</em>. We sample a set of such filler-values \(V \sim \mathbb{P}_{V\vert T}(\cdot \vert T)\) and plug them into the template, producing a pair of a question and an answer \(\left(T(V)_Q, T(V)_A\right)\).</li> </ol> <p>We are interested in whether a language model \(m\) answers a question correctly. We model this with the random variable \(X_m\), defined as</p> \[X_m = \mathbb{I}\left(m(T(V)_Q) = T(V)_A\right),\] <p>where \(\mathbb{I}\) is the indicator function. The accuracy of model \(m\), denoted as \(p_m\), is then the expected value of \(X_m\), i.e., \(p_m = \mathbb{E}[X_m]\). The variable \(X_m\) follows a \(\text{Bernoulli}(p_m)\) distribution.</p> <p>In fact, since we care about the difference in model performance on GSM8K and GSM-Symbolic, we postulate that we have two random variables \(V^{8K}\) and \(V^{Symb}\), governed by two conditional distributions \(\mathbb{P}^{8K}_{V \vert T}\) and \(\mathbb{P}^{Symb}_{V \vert T}\), respectively. These two distributions may be the same or different.</p> <p>This setup can be represented by the following directed probabilistic graphical model:</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-towards-more-rigorous-llm-evals/gsm_prob_graph-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-towards-more-rigorous-llm-evals/gsm_prob_graph-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-towards-more-rigorous-llm-evals/gsm_prob_graph-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/2025/assets/img/2025-04-28-towards-more-rigorous-llm-evals/gsm_prob_graph.png" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>where, for the purpose of this analysis, the bottom-most arrows denote deterministic dependencies. </p> <p>Under this model, we have \(X_m^{8K} \sim \text{Bernoulli}\left(p_m^{8K}\right)\) and \(X_m^{Symb} \sim \text{Bernoulli}\left(p_m^{Symb}\right)\), where \(p_m^{8K}, p_m^{Symb} \in [0, 1]\) are our main parameters of interest.</p> <p>In this framework, we can describe the experimental setup of Mirzadeh et al.

We note that only \(\hat{p}_m^{8K}\) and the average \(\overline{\hat{p}_m^{Symb}} = \frac{1}{50}\sum_{j=1}^{50}\hat{p}_{m, j}^{Symb}\) are reported in the paper (Table 1, Appendix A.2 in <d-cite key="mirzadeh2024gsm"></d-cite>).</li> </ul> <p>Under the assumptions of this mathematical model, we can think of \(\hat{p}_m^{8K}\) as an observation from a random variable \(\hat{P}^{8K}_m \sim \frac{1}{100}Bin\left(100,p^{8K}_m\right)\). Similarly, each \(\hat{p}_{m, j}^{Symb}, \; 1 \le j \le 50\) is an observation of \(\hat{P}^{Symb}_m \sim \frac{1}{100} Bin\left(100,p^{Symb}_m\right)\).
